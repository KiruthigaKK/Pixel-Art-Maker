# Pixel-Art-Maker

In this project, need to design the pixel art maker where it takes the user input to create the grid and allows user to choose color/change color throught out the design and create their own pixel art.
To achieve that, I have updated the design.js to read the HTML element and get input from the form and webpage and updated the HTML elements style through js.
Added functions to add new element to page through js code based on the eventlistener.
Added comments for self explanation.
